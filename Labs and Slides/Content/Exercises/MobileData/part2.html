		<h1>Exercise 2: Adding SQLite.Net to your projects</h1>

		<h2>Duration</h2>
		<p>10 minutes</p>

		<!-- - - - - - - - - Goals - - - - - - - - -->

		<h2 id="goals">Lab goals</h2>

		<p>
			The goal of this exercise is to configure your development environment so that you
			can use SQLite within your Android, iOS, and Windows Phone projects. The high level steps to perform this
			in both Xamarin Studio and Visual Studio are listed below.
		</p>

		<ol>
			<li><strong>Windows Phone only:</strong> Install the SQLite for Windows Phone Extension.
			<li>Add the platform-independent SQLite.Net PCL to the People Portable Class Library.</li>
			<li>Add the platform-specific implementation of the SQLite.Net PCL to each platform-specific project.</li>
		</ol>

	<b>What is NuGet?</b>
	<br />
	NuGet allows developers to easily download, install, update, and remove
	3<sup>rd</sup>-party libraries within a Visual Studio project. These libraries are made available through the <a href="http://www.nuget.org">NuGet Gallery</a>, which is an online repository managed by Microsoft. NuGet was created by Microsoft and is available in Visual Studio through the <a href="http://docs.nuget.org/docs/start-here/installing-nuget">NuGet Package Manager</a> which is built into Visual Studio. As of Xamarin 3, NuGet has become fully integrated into the Xamarin IDE as well and is fully compatible with Visual Studio.
	To learn more about how to use NuGet in Xamarin Studio, check out the blog post, <a href="http://blog.xamarin.com/xamarin-studio-and-nuget/">Xamarin Studio and NuGet</a>.

		<h2 id="devEnv">Development Environment Notes</h2>
		<h3>Xamarin Studio on the Mac</h3>
		<p>
			Windows Phone is not a supported platform. Please work with the iOS and/or Android platforms only.
		</p>
		<h3>Visual Studio on Windows</h3>
		<p>
			Visual Studio 2013 Update 3, with the Windows Phone SDK, is required to follow along with the steps in the lab.
			To verify whether or not the Windows Phone SDK is installed in your development environment, go to Control Panel >
			Programs and Features. Select Microsoft Visual Studio 2013 in the list, and select the <strong>Change</strong> button.
			In the Visual Studio installation dialog, select the <strong>Modify</strong> button. If the Windows Phone 8.0 SDK list item
			does not contain a checkmark beside it, select it and click <strong>Update</strong> to install the SDK.

		</p>
		<p>
			iOS development will require a Mac to build and run. If you do not have a Mac available, please work
			with the Android and/or Windows Phone platforms only.

		<h1>Steps</h1>

		<p>
			Below are the step-by-step instructions to implement the exercise.
		</p>

		<h2>Install the SQLite for Windows Phone Extension</h2>
		<p>
			Since SQLite is not available by default on Windows, an extra step is required in Visual Studio to install the
			necessary SQLite native library on your Windows machine, which will in turn allow you to easily package SQLite
			with your Windows Phone apps. The SQLite for Windows Phone extension only needs to be downloaded and installed
			once per machine (not per project); however, you must always remember to include the SQLite extension as a
			reference within your Windows Phone projects.
		</p>

		<ol>
			<li>
				Launch Visual Studio, then select <strong>Tools > Extensions and Updates...</strong></li>
			<li>
				In the Extensions and Updates dialog, select the <strong>Online > Visual Studio Gallery</strong> node.
				Type <strong>sqlite</strong> within the search field and hit the Enter key.
			</li>
			<li>
				Locate the <strong>SQLite for Windows Phone</strong> extension within the search results and click Download.
				<div class="hintblock">
					<strong>Tip:</strong> If the SQLite for Windows Phone extension is not being returned within the search results, verify that your <a href="#devEnv">Visual Studio development environment</a> is configured properly. If you are still unable to retrieve the extension in the Extensions and Updates search results, use Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox to download the <strong>sqlite-wp80-winrt-3080600.vsix</strong> extension from the <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/download.html">SQLite Download page</a>. Do not use Internet Explorer, as it will download the file as a ZIP. Once the VSIX file is downloaded, double-click on it to launch the installation.
				</div>
				This action will launch the VSIX Installer which displays the license terms, and indicates the extension
				will be installed to a Global Location. Click Install to continue. Restart Visual Studio when prompted.
				<img src="./res/images/Part2_VS_InstallSQLiteExtension.png" alt="- - - - - - - - - MISSING IMAGE - - - - - - - - - -" />
			</li>
			<li>
				Once Visual Studio has restarted, open the <strong>People</strong> solution contained within the <strong>Part02_Start</strong> folder.
			</li>
			<li>
				Right-click the References node within the Windows Phone project and select <strong>Add Reference...</strong>
				Click on the <strong>Windows Phone SDK > Extensions</strong> node, and select the SQLite for Windows Phone extension to add it
				to the project. This will add the native SQLite library (sqlite3.dll) to the project.

			</li>
			<li>
				Select <strong>Build | Configuration Manager...</strong> from the menu. In the Build Configuration Manager dialog,
				select x86 or ARM as the target platform of your Windows Phone project, in order to be able to build your project
				with SQLite.
				<br/>
				<strong>Note:</strong> Use x86 when testing the Windows Phone project in the Emulator, and ARM when testing on the actual device.
			</li>
			<li>
				Build your solution to verify it will compile.
			</li>
		</ol>
		<h2>Add the platform-independent SQLite.Net PCL to the People Portable Class Library.</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>
				If you are using Xamarin Studio, right-click the <strong>Packages</strong> folder in the <strong>People</strong> Portable Class Library project and select
				<strong>Add Packages...</strong> from the popup menu. In the Search field, enter <code>sqlite.net pcl</code>.
				Select the SQLite.Net component in the list, and add it to the project.
				<img src="./res/images/Part2_XS_AddPackages.png" alt="- - - - - - - - - MISSING IMAGE - - - - - - - - - -" />

				If you are using Visual Studio, right-click on the <strong>People</strong> Portable Class Library project name within Solution Explorer,
				select <strong>Manage Nuget Packages...</strong>, and select the Online node. Enter <code>sqlite.net pcl</code>
				in the Search field. Select the SQLite.Net package in the list and install. Ensure you select the proper SQLite.Net
				package, and not the one marked as Prerelease as shown below.
				<img src="./res/images/Part2_VS_ManageNugetPkg.png" alt="- - - - - - - - - MISSING IMAGE - - - - - - - - - -" />
			</li>
		</ol>
		<h2>Add the platform-specific implementation of the SQLite.Net PCL to each platform-specific project.</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>
				<strong>Android</strong>: Use the same steps as above to launch Nuget Package Manager for your Android project.
				Enter <strong>sqlite-net android</strong> in the search field. In the search results, select the
				<strong>SQLite.Net PCL - XamarinAndroid Platform</strong> Nuget package and click Install.
				Once the Nuget package has installed successfully, close the Nuget Package Manager dialog.

			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>iOS</strong>: Use the same steps as above to launch Nuget Package Manager for your Android project.
				Enter <strong>sqlite-net ios</strong> in the search field. In the search results, select the
				<strong>SQLite.Net PCL - XamarinIOS Platform</strong> Nuget package and click Install.
				Once the Nuget package has installed successfully, close the Nuget Package Manager dialog.

			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Windows Phone</strong>: In Visual Studio, right-click on the People.WinPhone project,
				and perform the same steps as above to launch the Nuget Package Manager.
				Type in <strong>sqlite-net wp8</strong> in the search field, and hit Enter.
				In the search results, select the <strong>SQLite.Net PCL - WindowsPhone8 Platform</strong> Nuget package and click Install.
				Once the Nuget package has installed successfully, close the Nuget Package Manager dialog.

			</li>
		</ol>
