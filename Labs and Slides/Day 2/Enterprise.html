					<div class="header">Working with Web Services</div>
					Mobile applications often need to access and consume data from outside services and in this session we will explore how to integrate with and use web services in our mobile applications. We will look at both RESTful services and SOAP-based services using the built in WCF support in the framework.

					Being disconnected from the cloud but caching local data that synchronizes upon reconnection is a common scenario in Enterprise applications. In this class we're going to look at the change of local data caching and synchronization from a general problem, and then examine some frameworks that attempt to solve this challenge.
