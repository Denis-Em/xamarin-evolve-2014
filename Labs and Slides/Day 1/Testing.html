					<div class="header">Introduction to Testing and Unit Testing</div>
					Testing is perhaps the most important part of the development process. Applications that frequently crash, destory data or misbehave won't last long on user's devices! This session introduces the concepts of testing, testing frameworks and how to develop a set of tests to improve the quality of your apps.

					<div class="header">Continuous Integration with TestCloud</div>
					Continuous Integration (CI) can improve the quality of your application by finding bugs faster. In this talk we will introduce the software engineering practice of Continous Integration (CI) and how it can be used to help create better software. We will discuss some of the tools involved and go over the steps necessary to setup a CI server.
